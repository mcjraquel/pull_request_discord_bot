# pull_request_discord_bot
A Discord bot to easily track pull requests

## How To Use This Bot
1. Clone this repo
2. Move to the cloned repo's directory
3. Install NPM dependencies using `npm install`
4. Run the app using `node index.js`

**Note:** I recommend to download [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package//nodemon), which saves time in restarting your application when updating files. With Nodemon, you'll have to start the application using `nodemon index.js`.
